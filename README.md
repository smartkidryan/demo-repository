Hey there! My name is Ryan Harper, I am a senior in Electrical Engineering at Mississippi State University. I am from Philadelphia, MS. I am interested in Electromagnetic Spectrum as a whole! In my free time, I like to read and swim (if I ever get free time). This repository is a demo for my Senior Design I class.
